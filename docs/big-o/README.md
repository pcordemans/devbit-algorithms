# Complexity Analysis

Many programming solutions may exist for a given problem. Question is: which is the most efficient? 
Measuring execution time or memory usage might be a good idea, but these factors depend on:

1. Amount of data
1. Hardware of the computer
1. Other applications running on the computer
1. On the programming language used (or the compiler, interpreter, etc.)
1. And the algorithm must be implemented before it can be measured

An alternative is to analyse the complexity of the algorithm, both running time and space usage.

## Conda

1. Install [miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for your OS.
1. Add *condabin* to your PATH environment variable.
1. Check the installation with:

    ```bash
    conda --version
    ```

1. Update conda:

    ```bash
    conda update conda
    ```
