# Algorithms

> This is the algorithms course for the Devbit curriculum. All programming examples are in Python. This course is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. Contributions to this course are accepted on [GitHub](https://github.com/pcordemans/devbit-algorithms).

## Course goals

In the algorithms course the goal is to analyse problems and select appropriate data structures and algorithms. We implement these in a software program and test them.

## Course approach

1. Learn theoretical concepts on algorithms & data structures.
2. Write software and tests in Python implementing and using these algorithms and data structures.

## Course overview

The course focusses on data structures, algorithms and complexity analysis (Big O).

The subjects are:

* Linked Lists & Arrays
* Recursion
* Stack
* Dictionary
* Tree structures
* Sorting algorithms
* Graphs
